Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,2,2025-05-25,"The CBE app has been highly unreliable in recent weeks. It frequently fails to work properly on both Ethio Telecom and Safaricom networks, whether using Wi-Fi or mobile data. This week, the system was down entirely for extended periods, making it very difficult to access banking services. The app only functions intermittently, and the lack of consistency is frustrating. I hope the issues are addressed soon, and that any non-technical influences are removed from such essential services.",9e6b8e08-8acf-4e1f-a179-a5a703ff2ebc,Google Play Store,-0.9997394680976868,NEGATIVE

Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,5,2025-05-31,this app has developed in a very good ways but there are some comments I need to make 1- preventing the screenshot likely not good for someone like me coz I need to make screenshot for quicker evidence. 2-it would be good if you make us to access recent transaction histories for 30 days coz we don't have to go to the Bank's in person to see old transactions or add colander category so user can easily access old transactions through colanders.,50ffac9d-437d-4d26-af4f-b6b0153d55fd,Google Play Store,-0.9983141422271729,NEGATIVE
